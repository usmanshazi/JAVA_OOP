# JAVA_OOP
Solution using Java object-oriented programming that simulates checking the student's answers for multiple-choice questions against the answer key and then generating the student's final grade.

Note that the generated string contains uppercase and lowercase to represent student answers for each multiple-choice question. There are 50 answers (just for example). Your task is to extract useful information and generate the grade for the student using the following facts: 
•	The student will receive two marks for each correct answer and zero for each wrong answer.
•	The student's final grade on this test will be out of 100. 

At the end of the test, the system generated a string containing the following information: student name, student ID, and the student's answers to the questions. Note that the generated string is comma separated.
